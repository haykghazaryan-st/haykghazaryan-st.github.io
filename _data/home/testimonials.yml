  - name: Sona Levonyan
    position: Customer Support Supervisor at ServiceTitan Armenia
    quote: The first thing that attracted me to join ServiceTitan was our founders’ vision, which managed to unite about 1000 people. All of us have ideas which we think are worth implementation, but not everyone is capable of taking this path with a strict determination to succeed. Ara and Vahe did it, and that fact is truly fascinating and inspiring. With 10 years of experience in Customer Service, I feel that all my skills and abilities are being utilized to the maximum at ServiceTitan. What I enjoy about working in Customer Support is finding solutions to the challenges our customers are facing and seeing the satisfaction they show after the solution is provided. Teamwork and dedication to achieve the extraordinary are what makes you a true Titan moving forward irrespective of the obstacles in your path.
