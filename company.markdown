ServiceTitan is the first Armenian-founded tech unicorn. CEO Ara Mahdessian and President Vahe Kuzoyan, both of Armenian descent, joined forces after college and founded ServiceTitan with a simple but challenging goal: to streamline their fathers’ home service businesses. Now, their company is responsible for transforming the entire home services industry.
