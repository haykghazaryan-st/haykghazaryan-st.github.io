ServiceTitan Armenia's "Expand the Extraordinary" campaign launch in early March was a success. What are we "expanding," you ask?

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="1ugivNRYfjc" %}

The goals of our campaign lead us to Berlin to share ServiceTitanâ€™s story. Berlin is the home of one of the largest expat communities of Armenian tech talent, and we were honored to network and learn with members of this community.

Back in March, "Expand the Extraordinary" visited Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

That started as a discussion of ServiceTitan's story and the future of Armenian tech turned into an inspiring night of networking and community-building with local tech talent.

There, we shared the opportunities we have here in Armenia for longterm learning as well as open jobs with high growth potential at ServiceTitan Armenia.

And the story doesn't end here - stay tuned for upcoming events (that don't require a flight to Europe)!
