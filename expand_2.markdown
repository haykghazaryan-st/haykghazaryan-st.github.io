Berlin is the home of one of the largest expat communities of Armenian tech talent, and we were honored to network and learn with members of this community.

Back in March 2020, "Expand the Extraordinary" visited Berlin. What started as a discussion of ServiceTitan's story and the future of Armenian tech turned into an inspiring night of networking and community-building with local tech talent.

There, we shared the opportunities we have here in Armenia for longterm learning as well as open jobs with high growth potential at ServiceTitan Armenia.
