ServiceTitan Armenia's "Expand the Extraordinary" campaign launch in early March was a success. What are we "expanding," you ask?

Our most recent event was a virtual one, allowing for participants from around the globe. We receive questions frequently from prospective talent regarding our team structure and the benefits of working at ServiceTitan, so we decided to offer answers to these questions and go into detail about what life is like at ServiceTitan.

Our second (this time online) event with the Armenian tech community in Europe was extraordinary!

<ul class="checkmark-list">
  <li>
    <p>We gave a comprehensive overview of ServiceTitan, "Zooming in" on everything starting from what departments we have all the way to our employee benefits;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talked about our thriving tech scene and the transformed social life of modern Armenia</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but not least, we expressed our utmost support to those who'd be willing to relocate to Armenia and the specifics of our relocation packages.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
