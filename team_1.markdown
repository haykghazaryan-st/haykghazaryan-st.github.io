We build for product excellence, focus on smart solutions through innovation and technology, have an amazing growth-oriented culture, and love to solve complex problems. We use the most modern tools on Microsoft .NET Core (C#) platform for backend and utilize React.js for frontend to build software that thousands of contractors are using on a daily basis.

Because ServiceTitan is growing rapidly, there are constantly projects the engineering team is working on in tandem. Not only are they working on existing products and maintaining them, but there is always a need to create new projects, design new highly scalable architectures, and find innovative ways to advance our technology. 
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
ServiceTitan’s core application is monolithic, but we have applied industry best practices to work on breaking down the monolith application into microservices for better scalability. We have a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and we’re constantly thinking about how to improve those services and how to define the variety of system architecture. Also we are actively  applying DevOps practices and leveraging  CI/CD and a lot of internal build-in automation tools to boost efficiency  of our teams. 
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
We have implemented the InnerSource software development strategy which enables software developers to contribute to the efforts of other teams, fostering transparency and openness to contributions from others.
