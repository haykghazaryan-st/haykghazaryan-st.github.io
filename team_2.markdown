The Product organization (Product & UX) is responsible for driving new product features from concept to successful launch with testing ideas, validating problems and gaining deep insights in customer needs and problems. 
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
Our product managers have the ability to independently drive large, cross-functional product initiatives, own the product vision and feature roadmap for ServiceTitan’s products, and act as a liaison across departments to identify product gaps, develop requirements, and communicate roadmaps.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
Product managers are also responsible for developing the go-to-market strategy with product marketing and external partners, and measuring the success of the product, and continuously gathering feedback from users. They define key objectives and ensure KPIs are tracked for measuring success.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
The design department includes the DesignOps team, who are hybrid designers and frontend developers and drive design decisions, the Product Design team, who balance research with prototyping, and the Service Design team, who perform most of the research we use to make strong product decisions and roadmapping.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
Many times design decisions are made by stakeholders, but those decisions are still validated by the three sides of the product design trinity: business, technical, and UX.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
The key objective of our design team is to have a shared understanding of the problem we're trying to solve. This involves dedicating time to research-based activities that can be performed by product managers, developers, designers and product marketers to legitimately validate the problems we’re trying to solve.
